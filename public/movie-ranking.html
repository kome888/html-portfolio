<h1>The best movie according to Yuuki</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movie.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Godzilla minus one</h3>
<p>I never seen this much synergy between the human story and a monster story<br />
in a monster movie before.</p>
<h3>The seven samurai</h3>
<p>Eventhough the movie is 2 hours long it is so entertaining that it doesn't<br />
feel that long at all.</p>
<h3>The Good, The Bad, The Ugly</h3>
<p>The three protaganits really are the stars of this movie.</p>
